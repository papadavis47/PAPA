I had an idea tonight for an app that I can build with electron. I am thinking
to build an app that I will call PAPA. Something that resonates with me. I can
buy the domain papa-app.io and start building it soon. I will use HTML, CSS
and Javascript to craft the app. I just have to decide on it's features. But I
think it can hold a lot of different things. Alot of thoughts I have had about
parenting and how to be better at it. I like the idea, alot. I think it could
be interesting. And it will be a great way to learn coding.

It could definitely be something that could keep me engaged. It could include
all sorts of stuff from documenting your kid, to keeping things organized, to
reflections on fatherhood and goal setting. New fathers, older fathers, ways
to stay in touch with kids as they get older. Ways of staying mindful.
Insights that one may have on being a father. Make it something that I would
want to to use. Anyway, it is an idea that I am going to be pursuing.

It is something that I can build on. There could also be a mobile version, a
web version, and a desktop version built on electron. I will focus at first on
the desktop electron version. Just build something for myself to use. That is
the best way I could go about it.
