I think that each child should have their own "book" in PAPA - and each "book"
should be able to be broken down in "chapters" and each "chapter" should have
it's own "pages". Ofcourse, each page should be shareable. Each book can have
as many pages as needed or wanted.  

There needs to be a place to keep notes and check boxes on each of the pages
that the user interacts with. These can be used to keep track of tasks and
check them off of a list. Just like in the notepad app, fromScratch - which I
am a fan of.

I also need it to look good and people should be able to switch between light
and dark - on each page. Two different modes - like on text editors - only for
each page in the app.
