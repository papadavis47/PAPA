## PAPA - AN ELECTRON DESKTOP APP

### ELEVATOR PITCH

This is a desktop application for journaling - built for fathers. It is a place to record thoughts and memories. It will be an electronic scrapbook - local to each users computer - cross platform. The user can add images or files - jot down ideas, plans and goals. A major feature will be a section called *I WANT YOU TO KNOW* within the app where users can share words with their children in the case of their death or absence of any kind, by setting a "code word" for each child. That child can then use that password to unlock the messages from the user. There should be a trusted partner - *also with a password** - who can unlock the "code words".

### USER STORIES

This app is for dads who spend a lot of time at their computer and would like to have a place where they can add information about their children as they are growing. It is for people who like to reflect. I am targeting users who wish they could download all their children related entries from Facebook over the years and have it all on their own computer. It is for fathers who place their parenting as the top priority in their life - and use the app as a tool to get better at their job. Also, for those that would like a way to keep "talking" to their kids - even if something happens to them and they can not be there for them.

### ARCHITECTURE

* Electron JS
* Node.js
* Chromium
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* React - *possibly*
* Material UI - *possibly*


### MVP

A functioning Electron app that the user can download from my GitHub repository and install on their computer with directions from the README.md file. Whether the user is running MacOS, Linux or Windows 10. It will have the following features:

* "Sections" - for each child.
* It will have an "About" section as well as a link to the GitHub repository.

* The ability to write and save dated journal entries locally to their computer and access those within the application every time it is launched.
* The ability to save image files or other files like pdf or text files - within the app.

## STRETCH GOALS
* Figure out a way to let the user write/preview - in markdown.
