I was watching the film, MOMENTUM GENERATION, today and I was thinking that I
need a place in PAPA where I can make note of various films or books or pieces
of art that I want to reference later. I want the app to be about "wellness"
and inspiration for fathers in their own lives and for the lives of their
kids. There should be a place in the app that is like a corkboard for
inspirations. And there should be a place to create tabs for films, TV shows,
magazine articles that can be found online - and collect them all together to
reference later.
